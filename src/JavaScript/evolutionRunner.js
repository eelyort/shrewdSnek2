class Evolution{
    // Parameters
    //  snakes has the snakes or snake to run in this evolution
    //  reproductions has an array of reproductions to use, along with the probabilities of each
    //  mutations is like above but for mutations
    //  numRuns is the amount of times to run each snake
    //  modeIn is the way any given snake's runs are normalized
    //  score function
    //   ticks per apple - the number of ticks a snake must survive to gain the same amount of points as an apple
    //   max time score - a percentage of how many apple's scores a snake can potentially gain for time
    //  timeouttime - the number of ticks a snake can go without eating an apple before being killed
    //   timeoutgrowth - amount of ticks added to timeouttime per length
