# shrewdSnek2
A webbased evolution simulator for the classic arcade game "snake." The end product will allow the user to view, load, and evolve different AIs to play the game snake.
Second version of "ShrewdSnek," goals are to have more organized, modular code which allows easier switching between different brains, such as supporting NEAT as well as other structures. It is also written entirely in javascript to be web friendly.
