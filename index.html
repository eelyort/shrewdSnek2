    <p>
        ShrewdSnek2 is an interactive evolution simulator. It allows someone without specialized knowledge to train their own AI's to play the classic arcade game "Snake."
        For more information, please scroll past the game window.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">Instructions</span>
    <p>
        Currently, the game is in showcase mode, where it plays randomly selected snakes that I trained previously. Floating your mouse over the top-left corner of the window should bring up a menu to begin.
        To begin evolving your very own snake, simply hit the "evolve" button and watch the magic happen. If you would like to customize/create the snake hit the "load" button.
        Doing so also allows you to browse all previous snakes and edit them at will. Lastly, the "edit evolution" button allows you to customize the evolution parameters.
        To replay a snake, you can either hit the "play" button or the un-pause button at the bottom of the window.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">How It Works</span>
    <p>
        This program works through the process of "neuro-evolution," which is a technique based off Darwinian Evolution.
        To put it simply, 1600~ snakes are generated randomly and play through the game in the background.
        Then, the snakes are ordered based off their scores, and the best are selected as "parents."
        The parents are then randomly mutated and produce "children" by having some of their "genes" crossed with another parent.
        Rinse and repeat for a few generations, and you have an AI that gets better through a combination of random chance and survival of the fittest.
    </p>

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">Project Goals</span>
    <p>
        As you can probably tell from the project name, this is the second version of ShrewdSnek. The first version was created by me and a classmate in high school, and can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/eelyort">github</a>.
        The first version was made in Java and while it did work, it had many problems. One, it was pretty inefficient, taking 6+ hours on a powerful computer to train anything which could even slightly play the game.
        Two, it was very inflexible, it only supported one type of snake with one set of inputs.
        Three, the code itself was an absolute mess and difficult to maintain.
        Thus, I decided to create a second version with the following goals in mind:
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Flexibility</span>
    <p>
        To make ShrewdSnek2 support any type of snake, I ended up creating a modular system where inputs, brains, mutations, and reproductions could all be easily swapped in and out.
        As a result, brains work with all inputs, and whenever I learn about and wish to add a new algorithm I only need to mess around in one file.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Accessibility</span>
    <p>
        Unlike the previous version, which required a java runtime and technical knowledge to use, I wanted anyone to be able to easily pull up ShrewdSnek2.
        This lead me to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing the project to exist as a website visible and runnable by any internet capable device.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Re-Usability</span>
    <p>
        During the development of this project, I created a formidable library of REACT and CSS components/classes which are very general in their use.
        The goal is to be able to use these components for all future projects.
        Accordingly, I tried to give them as much functionality as possible, even if I didn't use those functions in this particular project.
        Although some of them, especially the ones I first created, have a few major flaws which will probably necessitate their revamping, a good 90% of them appear good for regular use.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Organization</span>
    <p>
        Most of my personal projects have a tendency to be messy. However, as I wanted to be able to keep maintaining and using this project for a while, clean code was a must.
        Thus, I ended up spending much more time than usual planning this, including a .txt planning document. The results were... passable.
        Although unforeseen problems and their fixes have caused a fair bit of messy code, sitting here near the end of the project I find only a few things to clean up.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Learning</span>
    <p>
        As with most of my projects nowadays, my main goal with this project was to learn. This goal, at least, was completely met.
        I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and REACT from scratch, learned of tens of new methods of neuro-evolution, learned the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and
        learned the factors computer scientists use to judge the viability of using machine learning in the first place.
        I learned how to use CDN's, 3rd party libraries, and image editors.
        Most importantly, I learned many of my own strengths and weaknesses and how to better exploit my strengths to cover my weaknesses.
    </p>

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">Towards the Future</span>
    <p>
        As stated above, I intended to make this the final version of this project. With that in mind, I have the following improvements planned:
    </p>
    <span class="title small">UI Redesign</span>
    <p>
        Originally, I was going for a highly compact and clean look for the program itself.
        However, I've realized that for a program meant to be an evolution simulator, there is too much focus on the actual playing grid.
        Thus, I am planning on eventually moving the menu and information displays to the side so that the user can play with settings while watching the snakes.
        Frankly, since most of the ui are re-usable, general components, doing so should take a week at most.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Snake Components</span>
    <p>
        I would like to keep adding new inputs/brains/mutations as I learn them.
        In the near future I would like to add an input which simply contains the grid, perhaps centered on the head.
        I am also planning on adding recurrent brains, which have the added ability of memory.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Features</span>
    <p>
        The most important new features would be the ability to compare two snakes/evolutions side-by-side and some method of analyzing progress.
        For example, the evolutionRunner currently stores key statistics about each generation, but these statistics are currently unviewable.
        Perhaps a graph which shows progress over the generations of multiple different snakes?
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Databases</span>
    <p>
        Unlike the other improvements, I am on the fence about this one.
        I do believe that having a type of hub where you can upload your own snakes and view other people's snakes would be a good improvement.
        In addition, I would like to have the capability of saving snakes/settings through a login as that would be much easier to use than the current text saving.
        That said, there aren't really enough users neither to justify the server costs nor populate the hub.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Performance</span>
    <p>
        The main disadvantage of choosing JavaScript as the language is it's relatively slow speed.
        Not only is it slower than compiled languages, it's cpu and memory use is capped by the browser itself.
        To remedy this I have two plans.
        First, I will soon get true multithreading working, the reason it is currently only pseudo-multithreaded is because JavaScript web workers have stringent requirements.
        Secondly, I would eventually like to use libraries such as ccall to enable training in C++, which is much faster.
