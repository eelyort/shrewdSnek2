    <p>
        ShrewdSnek2 is an interactive evolution simulator. It allows someone without specialized knowledge to train their own ai's to play the classic arcade game "Snake."
        For more information, please scroll past the game window.
    </p>

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">Instructions</span>
    <p>
        Currently, the game is in showcase mode, where it plays randomly selected snakes that I trained previously. Floating your mouse over the top-left corner of the window should bring up a menu to begin.
        To begin evolving your very own snake, simply hit the "evolve" button and watch the magic happen. If you would like to customize/create the snake hit the "load" button.
        Doing so also allows you to browse all previous snakes and edit them at will. Lastly, the "edit evolution" button allows you to customize the evolution parameters.
    </p>

    <span class="title">How It Works</span>
    <p>
        This program works through the process of "neuro-evolution," which is a technique based off Darwinian Evolution.
        To put it simply, 1600~ snakes are generated randomly and play through the game in the background.
        Then, the snakes are ordered based off of their scores, and the best are selected as "parents."
        The parents are then randomly mutated and produce "children" by having some of their "genes" crossed with another parent.
        Rinse and repeat for a few generations, and you have ai that gets better through a combination of random chance and survival of the fittest.

<div class="info_text">
    <span class="title">Project Goals</span>
    <p>
        As you can probably tell from the project name, this is the second version of ShrewdSnek. The first version was created by me and a classmate in high school, and can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/eelyort">github</a>.
        The first version was made in Java and while it did work, it had many problems. One, it was pretty inefficient, taking 6+ hours on a powerful computer to train anything which could even slightly play the game.
        Two, it was very inflexible, you could only train one type of snake in one type of way. Three, the code itself was an absolute mess and difficult to maintain.
        Thus, I decided to create a second version with the following goals in mind:
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Flexibility</span>
    <p>
        In order to make it so that ShrewdSnek2 could support any type of snake, I ended up creating a modular system where inputs, brains, mutations, and reproductions could all be easily swapped in and out.
        As a result, brains work with all inputs, and whenever I learn about and wish to add a new algorithm I only need to mess around in one file.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Accessibility</span>
    <p>
        Unlike the previous version, which required a java runtime and technical knowledge to use, I wanted anyone to be able to easily pull up ShrewdSnek2.
        This lead me to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing the project to exist as a website visible and runnable by any internet capable device.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Organization</span>
    <p>
        Most of my personal projects have a tendency to be messy. However, as I wanted to be able to keep maintaining and using this project for a while, clean code was a must.
        Thus, I ended up spending much more time than usual planning this, including a .txt planning document. The results were... passable.
        Although unforeseen problems and their fixes have caused a fair bit of messy code, sitting here near the end of the project I find only a few things to clean up.
    </p>
    <span class="title small">Learning</span>
    <p>
        As with most of my projects nowadays, my main goal with this project was to learn. This goal, at least, was completely met.
        I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and REACT from scratch, learned of tens of new methods of neuro-evolution, learned the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and
        learned the factors computer scientists use to judge the viability of using machine learning in the first place.
        I learned how to use CDN's, 3rd party libraries, and image editors.
        Most importantly, I learned many of my own strengths and weaknesses and how to better exploit my strengths to cover my weaknesses.
